# Gofer Plan

You are creating a detailed technical implementation plan. This is the **third
stage** of the unified Gofer pipeline, combining architecture design, data
modeling, and API contracts.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Prerequisites

This command expects in `.specify/specs/{feature}/`:

- `research.md` - Codebase analysis (from $ $1_gofer_research)
- `spec.md` - Feature specification (from $ $2_gofer_specify)

If missing, prompt user to run the prerequisite stage.

---

## Outline

1. Context health check
2. Load context (lightweight)
3. Dispatch parallel planning agents (sub-agents handle heavy generation)
4. Review agent outputs
5. Optional multi-perspective review
6. Spec coverage validation
7. Output: `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`
8. EnterpriseAI default output: task-ready references to `context-bundle.md`,
   `contract-pack.md`, `reuse-scan.md`, and `audit-history.md`

---

## Step 0: Context Health Check

Before starting planning, assess context window health:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/check-context-health.sh
```

- If **< 50%**: Proceed normally
- If **50-70%**: Consider `/compact` - planning loads multiple documents
- If **> 70%**: Start new session with handoff summary

Planning dispatches multiple agents — keep main context lightweight.

---

## Step 1: Load Context (Lightweight)

1. **Run setup script**:

   ```bash
   .specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json
   ```

   Parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR, FEATURE_SPEC, BRANCH

2. **Scan existing documents** (do NOT load full content — agents read
   directly):
   - Note feature name from FEATURE_DIR
   - Note whether `discovery.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exist
   - Note whether `{FEATURE_DIR}/sequence-diagrams/selected-option.md` exists

3. **Note template path**: `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`

---

## Step 2: Dispatch Planning Agents

**CRITICAL**: You **MUST** launch these agents using the Task tool. Do NOT
perform this work inline in the main context. The main context should only
orchestrate and review agent outputs. Each agent reads source documents
independently and writes its output artifact.

### Agent 1: Implementation Plan Writer

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the general-purpose analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Generate a complete technical implementation plan for [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}

Read these files for full context:
- {FEATURE_DIR}/research.md — Technology decisions, integration points, patterns, constraints
- {FEATURE_DIR}/spec.md — User stories, requirements, success criteria
- .specify/templates/plan-template.md — Plan template structure
- .specify/memory/constitution.md — Project principles (read if exists)
- {FEATURE_DIR}/sequence-diagrams/selected-option.md — Selected approach (read if exists)

Generate the COMPLETE plan.md with these sections:

1. YAML frontmatter: feature, spec, research, status: ready, created (ISO date)
2. Technical Context:
   - Tech Stack (language, framework, database, testing — from research)
   - Architecture (how components fit together, with diagram description)
   - Integration Points table (Component | File | Integration Type)
   - Key Dependencies (existing modules, libraries)
3. Selected Implementation Approach (if selected-option.md exists):
   - Option number, scores, Gen AI touchpoints
4. Constitution Check (if constitution.md exists):
   - Verify alignment with each project principle
5. Implementation Phases (5 phases):
   - Phase 1: Setup & Foundation (directory structure, config, deps, base types)
   - Phase 2: Data Layer (entities, persistence, validation)
   - Phase 3: Business Logic (services per user story, business rules, integrations)
   - Phase 4: API/Interface Layer (endpoints per contracts, validation, auth)
   - Phase 5: Polish & Integration (logging, docs, performance, final testing)
   Each phase must have: Goal, Tasks (checkboxed), Verification criteria
6. File Structure (tree diagram of all new/modified files)
7. Risk Assessment table (Risk | Impact | Mitigation)
8. Spec Traceability:
   - User Story Coverage (Story | Status | Plan References)
   - Requirement Coverage (FR-ID | Status | Plan Reference)
   Verify 100% coverage of all user stories and functional requirements.

Rules:
- Every user story from spec.md MUST have plan coverage
- Every acceptance criterion MUST map to a plan component
- Every functional requirement MUST be addressed
- Reference specific file paths for all components
- Plan must be specific enough for task generation
- Resolve all unknowns — no NEEDS CLARIFICATION in the plan

Write the complete plan to {FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md.

Return a structured summary:
- Phase count and task count per phase
- User story coverage: N/N covered
- FR coverage: N/N covered
- Key architecture decisions made
- Any risks flagged as HIGH"
```

### Agent 2: Data Model Designer

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the general-purpose analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Design the data model for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}

Read these files:
- {FEATURE_DIR}/spec.md — User stories, requirements, key entities
- {FEATURE_DIR}/research.md — Existing data patterns, database context

If spec.md defines Key Entities or the feature involves data:

Generate {FEATURE_DIR}/data-model.md with:
1. Entity definitions with field tables (Field | Type | Required | Description)
2. Validation rules for each entity
3. Relationships between entities
4. State transition diagrams (Mermaid stateDiagram-v2) where applicable
5. Database considerations (indexing, migration approach)
6. Entity-to-UserStory mapping (which stories need which entities)

If the feature does NOT involve data entities:
Write a minimal data-model.md noting 'No data entities required for this feature.'

Return: entity count, relationship count, entities with state machines"
```

### Agent 3: API Contract Designer

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the general-purpose analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Design API contracts for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}

Read these files:
- {FEATURE_DIR}/spec.md — Functional requirements implying API endpoints
- {FEATURE_DIR}/research.md — Existing API patterns, conventions

If spec.md implies API endpoints (REST, internal, events):

Create contract files in {FEATURE_DIR}/contracts/:
- api.md — For REST/HTTP endpoints
- internal-api.md — For service-to-service contracts
- events.md — For event-based contracts

Each endpoint must include:
- Method and path
- Description
- Request schema (JSON example)
- Response schema (JSON example with status code)
- Error codes table (Code | Description)
- Which user story/FR it serves

If the feature has NO APIs:
Create {FEATURE_DIR}/contracts/api.md noting 'No API endpoints required.'

Return: endpoint count, contract files created, user stories served"
```

### Agent 4: Quickstart Guide Writer

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the general-purpose analysis in each., model="haiku"
Prompt: "Generate a quickstart testing guide for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}

Read these files:
- {FEATURE_DIR}/spec.md — What to test (acceptance criteria)
- {FEATURE_DIR}/research.md — Tech stack and testing framework info

Write {FEATURE_DIR}/quickstart.md with:
1. Prerequisites (what needs to be installed/configured)
2. Setup steps (how to get the feature running)
3. Manual Testing section (step-by-step test scenarios from acceptance criteria)
4. Automated Tests section (test commands)
5. Key Files table (File | Purpose)
6. Common Issues section (anticipated problems and solutions)

Return: scenario count, prerequisite count"
```

**Run all 4 agents in parallel.** Agents 2-4 read spec.md independently while
Agent 1 generates the plan.

### Agent 5-7: Visual Writers (Persona-Pack)

After the planning agents complete and write plan.md, data-model.md, and
contracts, dispatch three visual-writer sub-agents in parallel to produce the
developer-persona-pack visuals:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the visual-c4-writer analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Generate C4 Context and Container diagrams for {FEATURE_NAME}.
Feature dir: {FEATURE_DIR}. Read spec.md, research.md, plan.md.
Output to {FEATURE_DIR}/visuals/c4-context.md and c4-container.md."

**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the visual-bounded-context-writer analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Generate bounded-context map for {FEATURE_NAME}.
Feature dir: {FEATURE_DIR}. Read plan.md, data-model.md, contracts/.
Output to {FEATURE_DIR}/visuals/bounded-context.md."

**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the visual-erd-writer analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Generate data-model ERD for {FEATURE_NAME}.
Feature dir: {FEATURE_DIR}. Read data-model.md.
Output to {FEATURE_DIR}/visuals/data-model-erd.md."
```

These three artifacts (c4-container.md, bounded-context.md, data-model-erd.md)
are required for the developer persona pack. The persona-pack completeness gate
at $ $4_gofer_tasks start will warn if any are missing.

---

## Step 3: Review Agent Outputs

After all agents complete:

1. **Review plan.md** — Verify from Agent 1:
   - All user stories have plan coverage (check Spec Traceability section)
   - All functional requirements are addressed
   - Implementation phases are specific enough for task generation
   - File structure is consistent with existing codebase patterns

2. **Review data-model.md** — Verify from Agent 2:
   - All spec entities are covered
   - Relationships make sense
   - Validation rules are complete

3. **Review contracts** — Verify from Agent 3:
   - All implied API endpoints are defined
   - Request/response schemas are realistic
   - Error codes are appropriate

4. **Review quickstart.md** — Verify from Agent 4:
   - Test scenarios cover key acceptance criteria
   - Setup steps are realistic

5. **Fix any gaps** — Make targeted edits to any artifact with missing coverage

---

## Step 4: Spec Coverage Validation (GAP-01)

Dispatch a validator agent to cross-check plan against spec:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the general-purpose analysis in each., model="haiku"
Prompt: "Validate plan coverage of specification for feature at {FEATURE_DIR}.

Read:
- {FEATURE_DIR}/spec.md — Source of truth for requirements
- {FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md — Implementation plan to validate
- {FEATURE_DIR}/data-model.md — Data model to validate
- {FEATURE_DIR}/contracts/ — API contracts to validate (read all .md files)

Check these coverage dimensions:

1. USER STORY COVERAGE: Every user story in spec.md has at least one plan phase
2. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MAPPING: Every AC maps to a plan component
3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT COVERAGE: Every FR-XXX is addressed in plan
4. DATA MODEL COMPLETENESS: All Key Entities from spec appear in data-model.md
5. API CONTRACT COMPLETENESS: All implied APIs from spec have contracts

For each dimension, report:
- COVERED items with references
- MISSING items (ERROR — must be fixed)

Return:
- Coverage percentage per dimension
- List of MISSING items
- Overall PASS/FAIL status"
```

If validator reports MISSING items:

- Add missing components to the appropriate artifact
- Re-validate (max 3 iterations)
- **Proceed only when ALL spec items are traced to plan components**

---

## Step 5: Multi-Perspective Plan Review (Optional)

After generating the initial plan, optionally run multi-perspective strategies
to stress-test architectural decisions. **Skip this step if the plan is
straightforward or time-constrained.**

### Strategy #2: Solution Architecture Diverger

For features with significant architectural decisions, spawn 5 agents each using
a different pattern:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the plan-architecture-diverger analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Design architecture for [FEATURE] using Pattern [1-5].
Pattern 1: Microservices/modular  2: Monolithic/cohesive  3: Event-sourced
4: CQRS  5: Plugin-based
Spec: [FEATURE_DIR]/spec.md  Plan context: [summary of current plan]"
```

Run all 5 in parallel, then judge:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the multi-perspective-judge analysis in each., model="opus"
Prompt: "Judge verdict type: architecture selection.
Select the best architecture for this feature considering codebase fit, complexity, and testability.
[paste all 5 agent outputs]"
```

### Strategy #5: API Design Comparator

For features with API surfaces, compare paradigms:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the plan-api-comparator analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Design API for [FEATURE] using Paradigm [1-4].
Paradigm 1: REST  2: GraphQL  3: RPC  4: Event-based
Requirements: [API requirements from spec]"
```

Run 3-4 in parallel, then judge:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the multi-perspective-judge analysis in each., model="opus"
Prompt: "Judge verdict type: API paradigm selection.
[paste all agent outputs]"
```

### Strategy #7: Refactor vs Rewrite Advisor

For features that modify existing code significantly:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the plan-refactor-rewrite-advisor analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Perspective [1/2] for changing [CODE AREA].
Perspective 1: Plan minimal incremental refactor
Perspective 2: Plan clean rewrite
Current code: [file paths and summary]"
```

Run both in parallel, then judge:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the multi-perspective-judge analysis in each., model="opus"
Prompt: "Judge verdict type: refactor vs rewrite decision.
[paste both agent outputs]"
```

### Strategy #12: Migration Path Finder

When the feature requires migrating existing code or data:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the plan-migration-path-finder analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Design migration for [CHANGE] using Strategy [1-4].
Strategy 1: Big bang  2: Strangler fig  3: Feature-flagged  4: Adapter/facade
Migration scope: [what needs changing]"
```

Run all 4 in parallel, then judge:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the multi-perspective-judge analysis in each., model="opus"
Prompt: "Judge verdict type: migration strategy selection.
[paste all 4 agent outputs]"
```

### Strategy #16: Data Model Stress Tester

For features with data models, stress-test before finalizing:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the plan-data-model-stress-tester analysis in each., model="haiku"
Prompt: "Stress-test data model from Perspective [1-4].
Perspective 1: 10x scale  2: Concurrent access  3: Schema evolution  4: Edge-case shapes
Data model: [entities and relationships from plan]"
```

Run all 4 in parallel, then judge:

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the multi-perspective-judge analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Judge verdict type: data model robustness assessment.
[paste all 4 agent outputs]"
```

Incorporate judge recommendations into the plan before proceeding to validation.

---

## Step 6: Update Agent Context

Run the agent context update script:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude
```

This updates AI agent context files with new technology from this plan.

---

## Step 7: Engineering Review Gate (Up to 5 cycles)

Before proceeding to the next stage, run an iterative engineering review to
catch misalignment early.

### Review Cycle (repeat up to 5 times)

**You MUST dispatch 3 review agents in parallel** using the Task tool:

**Agent 1**: engineer-review (sonnet) — cross-check spec↔plan alignment

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the engineer-review analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Review alignment between spec.md and plan.md in {FEATURE_DIR}.
Find every gap, inconsistency, and misalignment between the specification
and the implementation plan. Report Red/Yellow/Gray findings."
```

**Agent 2**: codebase-analyzer (sonnet) — verify file paths and code patterns

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the codebase-analyzer analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Verify that the plan at {FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md references correct
file paths and follows existing codebase patterns from {FEATURE_DIR}/research.md.
Report Red/Yellow/Gray findings."
```

**Agent 3**: validation-correctness (sonnet) — verify acceptance criteria
coverage

```
**Note**: Codex CLI does not support the Task tool. For parallel agent work, open multiple Codex CLI sessions and run the validation-correctness analysis in each., model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Verify that every acceptance criterion in {FEATURE_DIR}/spec.md
is addressed by the plan at {FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md.
Report Red/Yellow/Gray findings with coverage gaps."
```

**After agents return:**

1. Classify findings: Red (blocking) / Yellow (should fix) / Gray
   (informational)
2. If NO Red or Yellow findings → PASS → proceed to auto-chain
3. If Red or Yellow findings exist: a. Fix findings directly in plan artifacts
   (Red first, then Yellow) b. Increment cycle counter c. If cycle <= 5 → re-run
   review agents d. If cycle > 5 → log remaining findings, proceed with warnings

---

## Step 8: Report and Continue

After all artifacts are created and review gate passes:

```
✓ Plan complete: {FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md

Artifacts created:
- plan.md: Implementation phases and architecture
- data-model.md: Entity definitions
- contracts/: API specifications
- quickstart.md: Testing guide

Engineering Review: PASSED (cycle [N] of 5)
```


---

## LLM Council Integration (Optional)

When council mode is enabled for `gofer_plan` stage:

1. Technical research queries go to all configured LLM providers
2. Different perspectives on architecture decisions
3. Chairman synthesizes best practices from multiple sources
4. Usage logged to `.specify/logs/council-usage.jsonl`

---

## EnterpriseAI Deployment Convention and EAI CLI Pinning Requirements

> When `gofer.workflowProfile=enterpriseai`, the following conventions apply.
> standard profile outputs remain unchanged.

When the workflow profile is `enterpriseai`, `plan.md` MUST capture:

1. **EAI CLI version pin** — record the installed `eai-cli` version as a
   `major.minor` pin (for example `2.0`). The plan stage resolves the local
   version via `eai-cli --version`, strips the patch component, and writes the
   pin to the `EnterpriseAI Profile Metadata` block of `plan-template.md` so
   every downstream task is reproducible. Plans MUST apply
   `pin guidance to `major.minor`` and never to a specific patch release.
2. **Deployment convention** — reference
   `.specify/references/eai/deployment-repo.md` for the canonical deployment
   pipeline and note which environment (dev/staging/prod) each deliverable
   targets.
3. **Integration map handoff** — restate the Vertical App → EAI Services →
   Deployment Target chain from `spec.md` and bind each link to a task
   identifier in `tasks.md`.
4. **Contract pack handoff** — reference `{FEATURE_DIR}/contract-pack.md` and
   bind each actor, object type, workflow/journey, permission boundary,
   API/event, runtime assumption, and acceptance test to plan sections and
   downstream tasks.
5. **AI-augmented journey handoff** — for app delivery, reference
   `{FEATURE_DIR}/journeys/base-journey.md` and plan the four-step-or-fewer
   user-facing process as the default scope spine. Each step must include the
   business goal, generative AI assistance mode, screen/user/data context used,
   completion signal, user controls, audit trail, and fallback/escalation path.
   If the plan expands beyond four user-facing steps, document why those steps
   cannot be combined, automated, or handled by the AI assistant.
6. **Reuse-before-create decision log** — reference `{FEATURE_DIR}/reuse-scan.md`
   for every new or extended EnterpriseAI object type, API/event, workflow, or
   module.
7. **Audit history seed** — create or update `{FEATURE_DIR}/audit-history.md`
   with stable finding IDs, decision exceptions, owner, expiry, and review
   cadence so validation can track recurring issues.

### EnterpriseAI Flow and Journey Separation

Plan both:

- **External user journeys**: the business/user-facing path, decision points,
  adoption impact, and measurable value.
- **AI-augmented app process**: for application delivery, the four-step-or-fewer
  journey with AI assistance, contextual prefill, conversational support,
  completion checks, and human controls at each step.
- **Internal orchestration flows**: platform services, ResourceAPI calls,
  events, data movement, tenant boundaries, deployment steps, and observability.

### Competitive / market analysis reference

When `includeCompetitiveAnalysis=true`, `plan.md` MUST link to
`market-analysis.md`. When disabled, the competitive-analysis section is omitted
and standard profile outputs remain unchanged.

---

## Observability Logging

At stage completion, log metrics:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/log-stage.sh 3_plan --complete --tokens [N] --compactions [N]
```

Logs to: `.specify/logs/pipeline.jsonl`

---



## Pipeline Continuation

This completes the 3_gofer_plan stage. To continue the Gofer pipeline:

**Next Command:** `$ $4_gofer_tasks`

The next stage will use the artifacts generated by this command and continue the implementation workflow.

**Note:** Codex CLI does not support automatic command chaining. You must manually run each stage command to progress through the pipeline.

## Key Rules

- Use absolute paths for all file references
- ERROR if constitution gates fail without justification
- All NEEDS CLARIFICATION must be resolved before completing
- Plan must be specific enough for task generation
- Log stage completion for observability tracking
