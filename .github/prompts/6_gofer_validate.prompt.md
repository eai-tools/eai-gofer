# Gofer Validate

You are validating that the implementation meets engineering quality standards
using a **10-category rubric scored out of 100 points**. This is the **sixth
stage** of the unified Gofer pipeline.

A score of **100/100 is required to pass**. Any category scoring 0 triggers
failure and a brownfield restart loop.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Prerequisites

This command expects in `.specify/specs/{feature}/`:

- `research.md` - Codebase analysis (from #1_gofer_research)
- `spec.md` - Feature specification (from #2_gofer_specify)
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan (from #3_gofer_plan)
- `tasks.md` - Task breakdown (from #4_gofer_tasks)
- Implemented code (from #5_gofer_implement)

---

## Outline

1. Context health check
2. Load implementation context
3. Spawn 6 specialist validation agents in parallel
4. Run automated checks (build, test, lint, typecheck)
5. Mutation testing gate
6. Mock ratio analysis
7. Semantic slop detection
8. Score the 10-category rubric
9. Generate enhanced validation report
10. Determine PASS/FAIL outcome
11. Brownfield restart on failure
12. Attribution logging to JSONL
13. Memory update check

## The Engineering Quality Rubric

### 10-Category Scoring (100 Points)

| #   | Category                   | Points | Pass Criteria                                                                                        | Agent                                         |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Functional Correctness     | 15     | Every acceptance criterion in spec.md has a passing test exercising real code                        | validation-correctness                        |
| 2   | Test Authenticity          | 15     | Zero skips, zero placeholders, zero mock-only assertions. Mutation score >= 60% if Stryker available | validation-test-quality                       |
| 3   | UI/E2E Verification        | 10     | If feature has UI: real rendering tests pass. If no UI: points redistribute                          | N/A (automated check)                         |
| 4   | Security Posture           | 10     | Zero hardcoded secrets, no disabled security features, no client-side keys                           | validation-security                           |
| 5   | Integration Reality        | 10     | Integration tests use real dependencies where possible. Contract tests validate boundaries           | validation-integration                        |
| 6   | Error Path Coverage        | 10     | Public functions tested for failure modes. No empty catch blocks                                     | validation-correctness + validation-standards |
| 7   | Architecture Compliance    | 10     | File structure and patterns match plan.md and research.md                                            | validation-standards                          |
| 8   | Performance Baseline       | 5      | No synchronous I/O in async paths, no unbounded loops, no N+1 patterns                               | validation-performance                        |
| 9   | Code Hygiene               | 10     | Zero AI slop: no TODO placeholders, no redundant comments, no magic numbers                          | validation-standards                          |
| 10  | Specification Traceability | 5      | Every user story maps to tests, every test maps to code                                              | validation-correctness                        |

### Point Redistribution (No-UI Features)

When a feature has **no UI component** (no web pages, no frontend, no visual
interface), the 10 points from UI/E2E Verification are redistributed:

- **+5 to Functional Correctness** (total: 20 points)
- **+5 to Test Authenticity** (total: 20 points)

**Detection**: Check plan.md tech stack. If no UI framework (React, Vue,
Angular, Svelte) and no Playwright/Cypress tests exist, this is a no-UI feature.

### Scoring Rules

- Each category scores **full points** or **0**. There is no partial credit.
- A category scores 0 if its agent reports any **Red (blocking)** finding.
- A category scores 0 if its automated check fails.
- **Total score** = sum of all category scores.
- **PASS** = 100/100. Anything less = FAIL.

---

## Step 0: Context Health Check

Before starting validation, assess context window health:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/check-context-health.sh
```

- If **< 50%**: Proceed normally
- If **50-70%**: Use sub-agents heavily, minimize main context
- If **> 70%**: Run `#7_gofer_save`, start new session, run `#8_gofer_resume`

Validation loads all artifacts and spawns 6 agents — context pressure is high.

---

## Step 1: Load Context

1. **Run setup script**:

   ```bash
   .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks
   ```

   Parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR

2. **Load all artifacts**:
   - spec.md (user stories, acceptance criteria)
   - plan.md (architecture, file structure, tech stack)
   - tasks.md (task completion status)
   - research.md (codebase patterns to follow)

3. **Detect iteration count**:
   - Check if `{FEATURE_DIR}/remediation-report.md` exists
   - If yes, read the iteration count from it
   - Track: `ITERATION = [1|2|3]` (first run = 1)

4. **Determine UI presence**:
   - Read plan.md tech stack
   - If UI framework present AND Playwright/Cypress tests exist: `HAS_UI = true`
   - Otherwise: `HAS_UI = false` → apply point redistribution

---

## Step 2: Spawn 6 Specialist Validation Agents

**CRITICAL**: You **MUST** launch all 6 agents **in parallel** using the Task
tool. Do NOT perform validation work inline in the main context. The main
context should only orchestrate, score the rubric, and review agent outputs.
Each agent receives the feature context and returns structured findings.

### Agent 1: Correctness Validator

```
Task: subagent_type="validation-correctness", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Validate functional correctness for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}
Spec: {FEATURE_DIR}/spec.md
Plan: {FEATURE_DIR}/plan.md

Check every acceptance criterion in spec.md.
For each criterion, find the test that exercises it and verify it tests real code.
Return findings in your standard report format (<2000 tokens)."
```

### Agent 2: Security Validator

```
Task: subagent_type="validation-security", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Validate security posture for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Scan all new/modified files (from tasks.md file paths).
Check for: hardcoded secrets, disabled security, auth bypass, client-side keys.
Return findings with Red/Yellow/Gray severity (<2000 tokens)."
```

### Agent 3: Performance Validator

```
Task: subagent_type="validation-performance", model="haiku"
Prompt: "Validate performance characteristics for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Scan all new/modified source files (from tasks.md file paths).
Check for: sync I/O in async paths, cyclomatic complexity > 12, unbounded loops.
Build scripts and test files are exempt.
Return findings with complexity scores (<2000 tokens)."
```

### Agent 4: Test Quality Validator

```
Task: subagent_type="validation-test-quality", model="haiku"
Prompt: "Validate test quality for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Scan test files related to the feature.
Check for: placeholder assertions, skipped tests, mock ratio, mock-only tests.
VSCode API mocks marked '// mock-justified: VSCode API' are exempt from ratio.
Return findings with mock ratio calculation (<2000 tokens)."
```

### Agent 5: Integration Validator

```
Task: subagent_type="validation-integration", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Validate integration contracts for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}
Check contracts/ directory if it exists.
Verify cross-component boundaries, type compatibility, integration test coverage.
Return findings with contract compliance status (<2000 tokens)."
```

### Agent 6: Standards Validator

```
Task: subagent_type="validation-standards", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Validate standards compliance for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}
Check against constitution.md (if exists) and research.md patterns.
Detect AI slop: redundant comments, over-engineered abstractions, silent failures.
Check code hygiene: TODO/FIXME, magic numbers, unused imports.
Return findings with severity tiers (<2000 tokens)."
```

### Agent 7: Security Red Team (Optional — Multi-Perspective)

When the feature involves security-sensitive code (authentication,
authorization, user input handling, external APIs), run the security red team
strategy (#13):

```
# Diverge: 3 attack perspectives
Task: subagent_type="validate-security-red-team", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Perspective 1: OWASP Top 10 attack analysis for feature [FEATURE_NAME].
Scan all new/modified files from tasks.md. Attack from OWASP perspective.
Return findings with exploit steps (<2000 tokens)."

Task: subagent_type="validate-security-red-team", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Perspective 2: Business logic abuse analysis for feature [FEATURE_NAME].
Scan all new/modified files from tasks.md. Attack business logic.
Return findings with exploit steps (<2000 tokens)."

Task: subagent_type="validate-security-red-team", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Perspective 3: CVE search for feature [FEATURE_NAME].
Check package.json dependencies for known CVEs.
Return findings with advisory references (<2000 tokens)."

# Converge: Judge synthesizes attack findings
Task: subagent_type="multi-perspective-judge", model="opus"
Prompt: "Synthesize 3 security red team perspectives for [FEATURE_NAME].
Perspective 1 (OWASP): [result]. Perspective 2 (Business Logic): [result].
Perspective 3 (CVE): [result].
Identify confirmed vulnerabilities vs false positives. Prioritize by exploitability."
```

**Run all 6 core agents in parallel.** Run Agent 7 (if applicable) in parallel
with the core agents. Collect all results before proceeding.

---

## Step 3: Run Automated Checks

Execute verification commands and capture results:

### Build Check

```bash
npm run build  # or appropriate build command
```

### Test Check

```bash
npm test  # or appropriate test command
```

### Lint Check

```bash
npm run lint  # or appropriate lint command
```

### Type Check (if TypeScript)

```bash
npm run typecheck  # or tsc --noEmit
```

Record results:

```
| Check     | Command          | Result        |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| Build     | npm run build    | PASS / FAIL   |
| Tests     | npm test         | PASS / FAIL   |
| Lint      | npm run lint     | PASS / FAIL   |
| TypeCheck | tsc --noEmit     | PASS / FAIL   |
```

**If Build or Tests FAIL**: Mark Functional Correctness as 0 immediately.

---

## Step 4: Mutation Testing Gate

Check if mutation testing tools are available:

```bash
npx stryker --version 2>/dev/null
```

### If Stryker is available:

1. Run mutation testing:
   ```bash
   npx stryker run --reporters clear-text 2>&1 | tail -50
   ```
2. Parse mutation score from output
3. Record: `MUTATION_SCORE = [N]%`
4. If score < 60%: contributes to Test Authenticity scoring 0

### If Stryker is NOT available:

1. Record: `MUTATION_SCORE = "unavailable"`
2. Log recommendation: "Install @stryker-mutator/core for mutation testing"
3. Test Authenticity is scored based on other criteria only (placeholders,
   skips, mock ratio)
4. Do NOT block on mutation score when Stryker is absent

---

## Step 5: Mock Ratio Analysis

Count mocking patterns vs real assertions across feature test files:

### Count Mock Calls

Use Grep to count in test files related to the feature:

- `vi.mock(` — module-level mocks
- `vi.fn(` — individual function mocks
- `jest.mock(` — Jest module mocks
- `jest.fn(` — Jest function mocks
- `.mockReturnValue(` — mock configurations
- `.mockResolvedValue(` — async mock configurations

### Count Real Assertions

Use Grep to count:

- `expect(` followed by `.toBe(`, `.toEqual(`, `.toContain(`, `.toThrow(`,
  `.toMatch(`, `.toBeGreaterThan(`, `.toBeLessThan(`, `.toBeDefined(`,
  `.toBeNull(`, `.toHaveLength(`, `.toHaveProperty(`

### Exclude Justified Mocks

Lines containing `// mock-justified:` are excluded from the mock count. This
allows VSCode API mocks and other unavoidable mocks to be documented and exempt.

### Calculate Ratio

```
MOCK_RATIO = mock_calls / (mock_calls + real_assertions)
```

### Evaluate

- If `MOCK_RATIO > 0.30` (30%): contributes to Test Authenticity scoring 0
- Report per-file ratios for the worst offenders

---

## Step 6: Semantic Slop Detection

### Automated Pattern Detection (Grep-based)

Run these checks on new/modified source files (not test files):

#### Red Severity (Blocks)

```
Pattern: expect(true).toBe(true)
Also: expect(1).toBe(1), expect('a').toBe('a')
Method: Grep for tautological assertions in test files
```

```
Pattern: test.skip / it.skip / describe.skip / xit / xdescribe
Method: Grep for skip patterns in feature-related test files
```

#### Yellow Severity (Must Address)

```
Pattern: TODO / FIXME / XXX / HACK in source code (not test helpers)
Method: Grep in new/modified .ts/.js/.py files
```

```
Pattern: Empty catch blocks — catch (e) {} or catch { }
Method: Grep for catch blocks with empty or whitespace-only bodies
```

#### Gray Severity (Informational)

Gray-level findings are reported by the specialist agents (Standards and Test
Quality). They include:

- Redundant comments restating code (agent: validation-standards)
- Over-engineered abstractions for one-time use (agent: validation-standards)
- Magic numbers without named constants (agent: validation-standards)
- Mock-only tests that verify wiring not behavior (agent:
  validation-test-quality)

### Consolidate Slop Findings

Combine automated Grep results with agent findings:

```
| # | Pattern | Severity | Source | Description | File | Line |
|---|---------|----------|--------|-------------|------|------|
| 1 | Placeholder test | Red | Grep | expect(true).toBe(true) | test.ts | 45 |
| 2 | Skipped test | Red | Grep | it.skip('should...') | spec.ts | 12 |
| 3 | TODO placeholder | Yellow | Grep | // TODO: implement | service.ts | 89 |
| 4 | Redundant comment | Yellow | Agent | "// create user" above createUser() | user.ts | 23 |
```

---

## Step 7: Score the 10-Category Rubric

Using agent reports, automated checks, and analysis from Steps 3-6, score each
category:

### Scoring Logic

**Category 1: Functional Correctness** ({15 or 20 if no UI} pts)

- Input: validation-correctness agent report + automated test results
- Score 0 if: Any Red finding from correctness agent, OR build/tests fail
- Score full if: All acceptance criteria verified with real tests

**Category 2: Test Authenticity** ({15 or 20 if no UI} pts)

- Input: validation-test-quality agent report + mutation score + mock ratio
- Score 0 if: Any placeholder assertion found, OR any test.skip found, OR mock
  ratio > 30%, OR mutation score < 60% (when Stryker available)
- Score full if: Zero placeholders, zero skips, mock ratio <= 30%

**Category 3: UI/E2E Verification** (10 pts, or 0 if redistributed)

- If `HAS_UI = false`: Skip (points already redistributed to Cat 1 & 2)
- If `HAS_UI = true`: Check for Playwright/Cypress test files that exercise real
  rendering. Score 0 if no real UI tests exist.

**Category 4: Security Posture** (10 pts)

- Input: validation-security agent report
- Score 0 if: Any Red finding from security agent
- Score full if: No Red or Yellow findings

**Category 5: Integration Reality** (10 pts)

- Input: validation-integration agent report
- Score 0 if: Any contract violation, OR critical boundary with zero tests
- Score full if: All contracts satisfied, integration tests use real deps

**Category 6: Error Path Coverage** (10 pts)

- Input: validation-correctness agent (error paths) + validation-standards agent
  (empty catch blocks)
- Score 0 if: Empty catch blocks found, OR public functions lack error path
  tests
- Score full if: Error paths tested, catch blocks handle errors properly

**Category 7: Architecture Compliance** (10 pts)

- Input: validation-standards agent report (architecture section)
- Score 0 if: File structure deviates from plan.md without justification
- Score full if: All files in expected locations, patterns followed

**Category 8: Performance Baseline** (5 pts)

- Input: validation-performance agent report
- Score 0 if: Sync I/O in async paths, OR complexity > 12, OR unbounded loops
- Score full if: No blocking performance findings

**Category 9: Code Hygiene** (10 pts)

- Input: validation-standards agent report (hygiene section) + slop detection
- Score 0 if: TODO placeholders in production code, OR > 5 redundant comments,
  OR silent error swallowing found
- Score full if: Clean code, no slop findings above Gray

**Category 10: Specification Traceability** (5 pts)

- Input: validation-correctness agent (criteria mapping)
- Score 0 if: User stories cannot be traced to tests and code
- Score full if: Every US has tests, every test maps to implementing code

### Calculate Total Score

```
TOTAL = Cat1 + Cat2 + Cat3 + ... + Cat10
```

Must equal 100 to PASS.

## Step 9: Determine Outcome

### If TOTAL = 100: PASS

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  VALIDATION PASSED: [Feature Name]
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Score: 100/100

  Rubric:
  ✓ Functional Correctness    [15/20]/[15/20]
  ✓ Test Authenticity          [15/20]/[15/20]
  ✓ UI/E2E Verification        [10/10 or N/A]
  ✓ Security Posture           10/10

```

Proceed to **Step 12: Attribution Logging** then **Step 13: Memory Update
Check**.


### If TOTAL < 100: FAIL

Proceed to **Step 10: Brownfield Restart**.

---

## Step 10: Brownfield Restart Loop

When validation fails (score < 100), generate a remediation report and signal
the orchestrator to restart the pipeline focused on failed areas.

### 10.1 Check Iteration Count

- If `ITERATION >= 3`: Generate **escalation report** instead (see 10.4)
- If `ITERATION < 3`: Generate **remediation report** and signal restart

### 10.2 Generate Remediation Report

Write to `{FEATURE_DIR}/remediation-report.md`:

```markdown
---
feature: [Feature Name]
iteration: [N]
score: [N]/100
generated: [ISO timestamp]
failed_categories: [list]
---

# Remediation Report: [Feature Name]

## Iteration [N] of 3

**Score**: [N]/100 **Status**: FAIL — Remediation Required

## Failed Categories

### [Category Name] (0/[points])

**Evidence**: [Specific findings from agent reports]

**Required Actions**:

1. [Specific action to fix this category]
2. [Another specific action]

**Files to modify**:

- `path/to/file.ts:line` — [what to change]

### [Next Failed Category]

...

## Remediation Scope

The following pipeline stages should re-run focused on these areas:

- **Research**: [Any new research needed, or "Not needed"]
- **Plan**: [Any plan updates, or "Not needed"]
- **Implement**: [Specific tasks to re-implement]
- **Validate**: Re-run after fixes

## Previous Iterations

| Iteration | Score   | Failed Categories | Date   |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| 1         | [N]/100 | [list]            | [date] |
| 2         | [N]/100 | [list]            | [date] |
```

### 10.3 Signal Orchestrator

Output the routing instruction:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  VALIDATION FAILED: [Feature Name]
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Score: [N]/100
  Iteration: [N] of 3

  Failed categories:
  ✗ [Category] — 0/[points]: [brief reason]
  ✗ [Category] — 0/[points]: [brief reason]

  Remediation report: {FEATURE_DIR}/remediation-report.md

  REMEDIATION REQUIRED: [feature-name]
  Failed categories: [list]
  Iteration: [N] of 3
  Route: #5_gofer_implement → focused on [failed areas]

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Then proceed to **Step 11: Attribution Logging**.

### 10.4 Escalation (Iteration 3 Failure)

If this is the 3rd iteration and validation still fails, generate
`{FEATURE_DIR}/escalation-report.md`:

```markdown
---
feature: [Feature Name]
iteration: 3
final_score: [N]/100
escalated: [ISO timestamp]
---

# Escalation Report: [Feature Name]

## Human Review Required

After 3 remediation attempts, the following categories still fail:

### [Category] — All 3 attempts failed

**Iteration history**:

1. Score [N] — [what was tried]
2. Score [N] — [what was tried]
3. Score [N] — [what was tried]

**Root cause assessment**: [Why automated remediation isn't working]

**Recommended human action**: [What a developer should do]

## Full Score History

| Iteration | Total | Cat1 | Cat2 | Cat3 | Cat4 | Cat5 | Cat6 | Cat7 | Cat8 | Cat9 | Cat10 |
| --------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1         | [N]   | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]   |
| 2         | [N]   | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]   |
| 3         | [N]   | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]  | [N]   |
```

Output:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ESCALATION: [Feature Name]
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  After 3 remediation attempts, validation still fails.
  Score: [N]/100

  Escalation report: {FEATURE_DIR}/escalation-report.md

  This feature requires human review before proceeding.
  The automated pipeline cannot resolve the remaining issues.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Step 11: Attribution Logging

Log every finding to `.specify/logs/validation-findings.jsonl`.

### Finding Format

For each finding from all agents and automated checks, append a JSON line:

```json
{
  "finding_id": "F[NNN]",
  "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]",
  "feature": "[feature-name]",
  "category": "[rubric_category_snake_case]",
  "severity": "[red|yellow|gray]",
  "description": "[finding description]",
  "file": "[file path]",
  "line": [line number or null],
  "agent": "[agent name or 'automated']",
  "resolution": null,
  "iteration": [N]
}
```

### Categories for `category` field

- `functional_correctness`
- `test_authenticity`
- `ui_e2e_verification`
- `security_posture`
- `integration_reality`
- `error_path_coverage`
- `architecture_compliance`
- `performance_baseline`
- `code_hygiene`
- `specification_traceability`

### Log Summary Entry

After all findings, append a summary entry:

```json
{
  "finding_id": "SUMMARY",
  "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]",
  "feature": "[feature-name]",
  "category": "summary",
  "severity": "info",
  "description": "Validation score: [N]/100. Categories failed: [list or 'none']",
  "file": null,
  "line": null,
  "agent": "rubric",
  "resolution": "[PASS|FAIL|ESCALATED]",
  "iteration": [N]
}
```

### Historical Reference

Before logging, read existing entries in `validation-findings.jsonl` for the
same feature. If the same finding (same file, same line, same category) appears
in a previous iteration, note it as a **repeat finding** in the description:

```
"description": "[REPEAT from iteration 1] expect(true).toBe(true) still present"
```

This enables tracking of findings that persist across remediation attempts.

## Step 12: Memory Update Check

After validation, assess whether learnings should be persisted.

### 12.1 Memory Update Decision Matrix

| Learning Type                | Update Location              | When to Update                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Project-wide patterns**    | `CLAUDE.md`                  | New conventions affecting all future work |
| **Architectural decisions**  | `.specify/memory/decisions/` | Significant design choices with rationale |
| **Feature-specific context** | `{FEATURE_DIR}/research.md`  | Discoveries relevant only to this feature |
| **Reusable code patterns**   | `CLAUDE.md` or constitution  | Patterns other features should follow     |
| **Bug workarounds**          | `.specify/memory/decisions/` | Issues that may recur                     |

### 12.2 CLAUDE.md Update Criteria

**DO update CLAUDE.md when**:

- Discovered a new coding convention used across the codebase
- Identified a critical dependency or integration pattern
- Found a gotcha that affects multiple features
- Established a new testing or build pattern

**DO NOT update CLAUDE.md when**:

- Learning is specific to one feature
- Information will become stale quickly
- Pattern is already documented elsewhere
- Change is experimental/temporary

### 12.3 Memory Update Checklist

Before completing validation, verify:

- [ ] Any project-wide patterns discovered -> added to CLAUDE.md?
- [ ] Any significant decisions made -> recorded in decisions/?
- [ ] Any gotchas or workarounds -> documented for future reference?
- [ ] Feature-specific learnings -> captured in research.md?

## LLM Council Integration (Optional)

When council mode is enabled for `gofer_validate` stage:

1. Multiple LLMs review the implementation independently
2. Each provider scores the rubric from their perspective
3. Chairman synthesizes scores — uses the **lowest** score for each category
   (conservative approach)
4. Highlights consensus issues (high confidence)
5. Notes divergent assessments needing human judgment
6. Usage logged to `.specify/logs/council-usage.jsonl`

---

## Observability Logging

At stage completion, log metrics:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/log-stage.sh 6_validate --complete --tokens [N] --compactions [N]
```

This also logs quality metrics (rubric scores, finding counts) to:
`.specify/logs/quality-metrics.jsonl`

---



## Pipeline Continuation

This completes the 6_gofer_validate stage. To continue the Gofer pipeline:

**Next Command:** `#6a_gofer_engineering_review`

The next stage will read the artifacts from this stage and continue the workflow automatically.

**Note:** Copilot Chat supports context preservation. Your conversation history will be maintained as you progress through pipeline stages.

## Key Rules

- **100/100 is the only passing score** — there is no "close enough"
- **Agents run in parallel** — spawn all 6 at once, do not serialize
- **Red findings block** — any Red finding in any agent zeroes that category
- **Mutation testing is optional** — gracefully degrade when Stryker absent
- **Mock ratio excludes justified mocks** — mark with `// mock-justified:`
  comment
- **Attribution logging is mandatory** — every finding gets logged to JSONL
- **Maximum 3 remediation iterations** — then escalate to human
- **Be specific** — cite file paths and line numbers for all findings
- **Score the rubric honestly** — the goal is to catch real problems, not to
  pass
- Log stage completion for observability tracking
