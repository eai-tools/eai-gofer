# Gofer Stakeholder Communications

You are generating a **stakeholder communications package** after a feature has
been validated. This is a **post-pipeline stage** that translates technical
implementation into business-friendly deliverables.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Prerequisites

This command expects in `.specify/specs/{feature}/`:

- `validation-report.md` — Feature validated (PASS) from #6_gofer_validate
- `problem-brief.md` — Original business problem (from /0a_problem_validation)
- `spec.md` — Feature specification (from #2_gofer_specify)
- `spec-summary.md` — Executive summary (from #2_gofer_specify)
- `assumptions.md` — Tracked assumptions

If `validation-report.md` doesn't exist or shows FAIL, do NOT generate comms.
Instead, inform the user that validation must pass first.

---

## Outline

1. Context health check
2. Load all feature context
3. Resolve Marp output mode (opt-in, default-recommended for EnterpriseAI)
4. Spawn comms-writer agent
5. Spawn business-metrics-analyzer agent
6. Generate stakeholder communications package
7. Generate business metrics dashboard
8. Final assumption review
9. Completion summary

---

## Step 0: Context Health Check

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/check-context-health.sh
```

- If **< 50%**: Proceed normally
- If **50-70%**: Use sub-agents heavily
- If **> 70%**: Run `#7_gofer_save` first

---

## Step 1: Load Feature Context

1. **Run setup script**:

   ```bash
   .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks
   ```

   Parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR

2. **Load all business artifacts**:
   - `problem-brief.md` — Original problem and business case
   - `discovery.md` — Business discovery context
   - `spec-summary.md` — Executive summary
   - `assumptions.md` — Assumption register
   - `validation-report.md` — Quality verification results
   - `tasks.md` — Implementation status

3. **Verify validation passed**:
   - Check `validation-report.md` for `status: PASS`
   - If FAIL: "Validation must pass before generating communications. Current
     score: [N]/100. Run #6_gofer_validate first."

---

## Step 2: Resolve Marp Output Mode (Opt-In, Default-Recommended)

Determine Marp behavior before drafting stakeholder artifacts:

- Treat Marp generation as an explicit run-level opt-in via `enableMarpDeck` (or
  equivalent run flag).
- Use default recommendation for `workflowProfile=enterpriseai`:
  `enableMarpDeck=true`.
- For standard/legacy runs, keep Marp disabled unless explicitly requested.
- Never block stakeholder communications when Marp is disabled.
- Always preserve legacy outputs (`release-notes.md` and `demo-script.md`)
  regardless of Marp mode.

---

## Step 3: Spawn Parallel Agents

Launch both agents **in parallel**:

### Agent 1: Communications Writer

```
Task: subagent_type="comms-writer", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Generate stakeholder communications for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}

Read and use:
- problem-brief.md for original problem context
- discovery.md for business discovery findings
- spec.md for what was specified
- spec-summary.md for business summary
- validation-report.md for quality status
- assumptions.md for tracked assumptions

Generate:
1. Executive summary (3 sentences)
2. Non-technical release notes
3. 5-minute demo script with talking points
4. Change management brief with rollout plan
5. Success metrics with baseline and targets
6. Communication timeline

Return structured report (<2000 tokens)."
```

### Agent 2: Business Metrics Analyzer

```
Task: subagent_type="business-metrics-analyzer", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Analyze pipeline metrics for business reporting.

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}
Logs directory: .specify/logs/

Read pipeline logs and feature artifacts to produce:
1. Feature velocity (delivery time for this feature)
2. Stage duration breakdown
3. Quality metrics (validation score, iterations)
4. Cost analysis (token usage)
5. Portfolio status (all features in .specify/specs/)
6. Scope health indicators

Return structured report (<2000 tokens)."
```

**Run both agents in parallel.**

---

## Step 4: Generate Stakeholder Communications

Write to `{FEATURE_DIR}/stakeholder-comms.md` using the template at
`.specify/templates/stakeholder-comms-template.md`. Also produce the legacy
companion artifacts:

- `{FEATURE_DIR}/release-notes.md`
- `{FEATURE_DIR}/demo-script.md`

Populate with comms-writer agent findings. Ensure:

- **All language is non-technical** — no jargon, no acronyms without explanation
- **Impact is quantified** — use numbers from problem-brief.md
- **Demo script is actionable** — someone could run the demo from this document
- **Change management is realistic** — phased rollout with success criteria
- **Metrics are tied to problem** — connect back to original business case

### Optional Marp Deck Output

When `workflowProfile=enterpriseai` and Marp opt-in is enabled
(`enableMarpDeck=true`), generate:

- `{FEATURE_DIR}/presentation.marp.md`

The deck MUST include valid Marp frontmatter plus these required sections:

1. Problem Statement
2. EnterpriseAI Solution Overview
3. Architecture Diagram Reference
4. Demo Script Summary
5. Success Metrics

Use this required template content:

```markdown
---
marp: true
theme: default
paginate: true
title: '{{feature-name}} Stakeholder Presentation'
---

# Problem Statement

- {{problem-summary}}
- {{who-is-impacted}}
- {{why-now}}

---

# EnterpriseAI Solution Overview

- {{solution-summary}}
- {{enterpriseai-fit}}
- {{expected-business-outcome}}

---

# Architecture Diagram Reference

- Diagram: {{architecture-diagram-path-or-link}}
- Components: {{vertical-app}} -> {{eai-services}} -> {{deployment-target}}
- Decision rationale: {{why-this-architecture}}

---

# Demo Script Summary

1. {{demo-step-1}}
2. {{demo-step-2}}
3. {{demo-step-3}}
4. {{demo-step-4}}

---

# Success Metrics

- {{metric-1}}: baseline {{current}} -> target {{target}}
- {{metric-2}}: baseline {{current}} -> target {{target}}
- {{metric-3}}: review cadence {{cadence}}
```

If Marp is not enabled, skip `presentation.marp.md` and continue generating
`stakeholder-comms.md`, `release-notes.md`, and `demo-script.md` without
interruption.

---

## Step 5: Generate Business Metrics Dashboard

Write to `{FEATURE_DIR}/business-metrics.md` using the template at
`.specify/templates/business-metrics-template.md`.

Populate with business-metrics-analyzer agent findings.

---

## Step 6: Final Assumption Review

Spawn the assumption-tracker agent to do a final review:

```
Task: subagent_type="assumption-tracker", model="haiku"
Prompt: "Final assumption review for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}

Read assumptions.md and cross-reference against:
- validation-report.md (did implementation reveal any disproven assumptions?)
- tasks.md (any tasks that changed because of assumption issues?)

Update assumption statuses based on implementation evidence.
Flag any assumptions that remain UNVALIDATED and could affect launch.

Return structured report (<2000 tokens)."
```

### Update Assumptions

Based on agent findings, update `{FEATURE_DIR}/assumptions.md`:

- Mark assumptions validated by implementation as `VALIDATED`
- Mark assumptions disproven during development as `DISPROVEN`
- Flag remaining `UNVALIDATED` assumptions with recommended verification actions

---

## Step 7: Generate Scope Creep Report (If problem-brief exists)

If `{FEATURE_DIR}/problem-brief.md` exists, run scope creep detection:

```
Task: subagent_type="scope-creep-detector", model="haiku"
Prompt: "Analyze scope creep for feature [FEATURE_NAME].

Feature directory: {FEATURE_DIR}

Compare the final implementation (tasks.md, spec.md) against the original
problem brief (problem-brief.md). Calculate scope creep score.

Return structured report (<2000 tokens)."
```

If scope creep score > 25%, include a "Scope Evolution" section in the
stakeholder communications explaining what changed and why.

---

## Step 8: Completion Summary

## Step 9: Observability Logging

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/log-stage.sh 7a_stakeholder_comms --complete --tokens [N] --compactions [N]
```

---

## Important Notes

- **Every output must be copy-pasteable** — consultants share these as-is
- **No technical jargon** — write for business executives
- **Connect to business case** — always reference problem-brief.md impact
  metrics
- **Be honest about limitations** — known issues build trust
- **Include timelines** — consultants need to plan around dates
- **Quantify everything** — numbers > adjectives
- **Demo script must work** — test it mentally before writing

---

## LLM Council Integration

When council mode is configured in `.specify/memory/council-config.yaml` for
stakeholder communications:

1. Multiple LLMs draft communications independently
2. Chairman synthesizes best elements from each
3. Ensures diverse writing styles and perspectives
4. Usage logged to `.specify/logs/council-usage.jsonl`
