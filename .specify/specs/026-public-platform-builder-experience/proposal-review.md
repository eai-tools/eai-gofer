# Proposal Review

## Approved Scope

Create the repo-owned Gofer artifacts required to plan the public platform builder experience for Gofer. This PR is specification/bootstrap only; it does not claim that runtime platform behavior is implemented.

## Decision

Proceed with a draft PR that establishes Gofer's responsibilities, public/private boundary, implementation roadmap, traceability, and validation evidence for Feature 026.

## Implementation Boundary

The implementation work that changes runtime behavior remains a follow-up PR set. This PR must stay safe to merge independently because it adds planning and validation artifacts only.

## Approval Notes

- Public builder automation remains PublicAPI-only.
- Public-facing docs and tooling must not disclose private platform topology.
- Any paid, quota, or operator-limited capability must be represented as a public capability state, not a client-side bypass.
