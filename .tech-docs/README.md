# Gofer

Gofer is a business specification-driven delivery workflow for repositories. It
provides a shared `0-6` pipeline, repo-owned artifacts in `.specify/`, a VS Code
extension, and portable plugin surfaces for Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot,
and Gemini.

## Core Pipeline

| Stage             | Command                | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Business Scenario | `/0_business_scenario` | Kick off the workflow, gather context, and route the work    |
| Research          | `/1_gofer_research`    | Explore the codebase, constraints, and delivery options      |
| Specify           | `/2_gofer_specify`     | Write the feature specification                              |
| Plan              | `/3_gofer_plan`        | Produce architecture, data model, and contracts              |
| Tasks             | `/4_gofer_tasks`       | Break the work into dependency-ordered execution units       |
| Implement         | `/5_gofer_implement`   | Make code and documentation changes                          |
| Validate          | `/6_gofer_validate`    | Run validation, blast-radius review, and final quality gates |

Optional helpers:

- `/0a_problem_validation`
- `/7_gofer_save`
- `/8_gofer_resume`
- `/9_gofer_tests`
- `/7a_stakeholder_comms`
- `/gofer:check-workspace`
- `/gofer:bootstrap-workspace`

## Install Surfaces

| Surface            | Recommended source                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| VS Code            | Marketplace first, VSIX as fallback      |
| Claude Code        | `eai-tools/eai-gofer` GitHub marketplace |
| Codex              | GitHub repo marketplace                  |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | GitHub repo marketplace                  |
| Gemini CLI         | GitHub repo install with `--auto-update` |

## Model And Cost Policy

Bootstrap creates a user-owned model policy at
`.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml` from the shipped
`.specify/templates/gofer-model-policy.yaml` template. Edit the memory copy to
tune simple, medium, hard, and arbiter routes across Claude, Codex/OpenAI,
Gemini, and Copilot. Copilot uses `Auto` for simple/default work by default
because exact model availability depends on client, plan, and organization
policy.

## Public Launch Notes

This documentation set is being cleaned up for a public launch. Community health
files, GitHub Discussions, contributor routing, and public install paths are now
first-class. Remaining legacy enterprise-profile internals are tracked
separately as follow-up launch work.
