## Core Pipeline Stages

### 0_business_scenario

Define the business problem and scenario for Gofer to analyse and solve.

### 1_gofer_research

Research codebase, CLI integrations, and technology landscape for the target
feature.

### 2_gofer_specify

Generate a feature specification from research findings and approved proposal
review.

### 3_gofer_plan

Create a detailed technical implementation plan with architecture, data model,
and contracts.

### 4_gofer_tasks

Break down the implementation plan into dependency-ordered, parallelisable
tasks.

### 5_gofer_implement

Execute all tasks from tasks.md phase by phase with feedback loops and
engineering review.

### 6_gofer_validate

Validate implemented work with evidence-backed scoring, blast-radius analysis,
and engineering review.

## Optional Helper Commands

### 0a_problem_validation

Validate the business problem using 5 Whys root-cause analysis and stakeholder
mapping when the kickoff needs deeper framing.

### 7_gofer_save

Save session state and create a handoff checkpoint for resumption in a new
context.

### 8_gofer_resume

Resume a previous Gofer session from a saved checkpoint file.

### 9_gofer_tests

Generate comprehensive test suites from four testing perspectives for a target
component.

### 10_gofer_cloud

Deploy and configure the Gofer cloud integration for remote pipeline execution.

### 7a_stakeholder_comms

Generate stakeholder-facing communications after validation as an optional
follow-up, not a core pipeline stage.

### gofer_constitution

Create or update project constitution with coding principles and guidelines.

### gofer_hydrate

Reverse-engineer specification from existing code (Hydration).

### gofer:personality

Set the assistant personality for this Gofer session: friendly, pragmatic, or
none (default).

### gofer:plan

Toggle plan mode in the active CLI session for the next user prompt;
non-pipeline control command.

### gofer:side

Open a side conversation in the active CLI without disturbing the main pipeline
state; resumable.

### gofer:check-workspace

Check whether this repo is initialized for Gofer and explain any missing or
stale scaffold.

### gofer:bootstrap-workspace

Create or update the repo-owned Gofer scaffold for the current workspace.

### gofer:eai-first-run

Prepare tools, login, tenant, template, and Gofer for a first EAI app.

### gofer:vocabulary

Extract domain terminology into a canonical feature glossary.

### gofer:diagnose

Run a reproduce-minimize-instrument-fix loop for bugs and failing tests.

### gofer:tdd

Guide a red-green-refactor loop tied to spec acceptance criteria.

### gofer:spec-summary

Generate a business-friendly summary of feature value and scope.

### gofer:zoom-out

Show how the current feature connects to broader system boundaries.

## Commands

No commands detected. Add build/test/lint scripts to your project.

## Code Style

### Code Conventions

- Follow existing code style and naming conventions in this project
- Write clear, self-documenting code with descriptive names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments only where the logic is not self-evident
- Handle errors at appropriate boundaries

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality before marking tasks complete
- Run the full test suite before committing

## Git Workflow

- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:)
- Create feature branches for new work
- Run tests and linting before committing

## Gofer Pipeline

This project uses Gofer for spec-driven development. Run `/0_business_scenario`
to start the core pipeline (business scenario -> research -> specify -> plan ->
tasks -> implement -> validate). `/6_gofer_validate` is the terminal quality
gate and includes the final engineering review loop. Artifacts in
`.specify/specs/{feature}/`.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal
  code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer
  standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid
  introducing bugs.
