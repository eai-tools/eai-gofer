## Workspace Preflight

Before doing stage/helper work:

1. Resolve the repository root.
2. Check the core Gofer sentinels:
   - `.specify/.gofer-version`
   - `.specify/commands/0_business_scenario.md`
   - `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`
   - `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh`
   - `.specify/scripts/node/parse-stage-command.mjs`
   - `.specify/scripts/hooks/post-tool-use.mjs`
   - `.specify/scripts/powershell/install-optional-tools.ps1`
   - `.specify/templates/gofer-model-policy.yaml`
   - `.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml`
   - `.specify/specs/`
   - `.specify/memory/`
3. Check host-specific repo-owned files when relevant:
   - Claude: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`
   - Codex: `AGENTS.md`
   - Copilot: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - VS Code extension mirrors Claude/Copilot/Gemini resources itself and should still keep the core scaffold healthy
4. If the repo already has the workspace checker script, prefer running:
   - `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-workspace-check.mjs --host claude --json`
5. If the workspace is missing or stale, ask exactly:
   - **"This repo is missing or stale for Gofer. Initialize/update it now?"**
6. If the user says yes, run the Gofer workspace bootstrap helper and then resume this command from the top.
7. If the user says no, stop and explain that Gofer stage/helper work depends on the repo-owned scaffold.


# Gofer Zoom Out

## Token And Cost Policy
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:start -->

Before spawning agents, calling tools, or loading large files:

1. Treat `.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml` as the repo-owned source of truth for simple, medium, hard, and arbiter model routing. If it is missing, run `/gofer:bootstrap-workspace` before continuing.
2. Use the cheapest capable model first.
   - Claude: Haiku for scouting/extraction; Sonnet for normal implementation, synthesis, validation, and security; Opus for high-risk arbitration or release-critical failures.
   - Codex/OpenAI: GPT mini for simple coding; GPT nano only for locate/classify/summarize/mechanical work; GPT-5.3-Codex or flagship GPT for tool-heavy coding, architecture, and release-critical validation.
   - Gemini: Flash-Lite for cheap large-context scan/summarize; Flash for default research synthesis; Pro for large-context architecture or high-risk arbitration.
   - Copilot: prefer Auto for simple and default work; ask the user before choosing a paid/high-tier picker model for hard security, architecture, or release gates.
3. Keep raw tool output out of the main conversation context. Save stable findings to `.specify/specs/{feature}/context-bundle.md`, then work from summaries.
4. Use provider prompt/context caching only for stable, non-secret prefixes: Gofer scaffold, AGENTS/CLAUDE/Copilot instructions, constitution, repo map, stage contracts, and validation rubric.
5. Before continuing after large research, planning, implementation, or validation bursts, checkpoint the durable artifacts and compact/clear/resume context when the host supports it.
6. Escalate model tier only when a cheaper pass is low-confidence, contradictory, security-sensitive, or blocking release quality.
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:end -->

Expand the current feature into its surrounding system context and write the
result to `.specify/specs/{feature}/zoom-out-report.md`.

Use this helper when the feature needs broader architectural framing: upstream
dependencies, downstream consumers, or cross-cutting risks that are easy to
miss inside a narrow task view.

When you run this helper:

1. Read the approved feature-local artifacts and identify the current boundary
   being changed.
2. Map the upstream inputs, downstream consumers, and cross-cutting impacts that
   materially affect the feature.
3. Keep the output feature-local and architecture-focused.
4. Write the artifact only to
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/zoom-out-report.md`.
5. If the target file already exists, replace it and prepend a regeneration note
   such as `<!-- regenerated at [ISO timestamp] -->`.
6. Include the minimum provenance schema:
   - `GeneratedAt`
   - `SourceCommandId`
   - `SourceInputs`
   - `OverwriteNoticeWhenApplicable`

The generated zoom-out report must contain these sections:

- `## Provenance`
- `## Current Boundary`
- `## Upstream/Downstream`
- `## Cross-Cutting Impact`

Keep the content Gofer-owned. Do not copy upstream Matt Pocock skill text
verbatim.
