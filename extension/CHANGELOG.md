# Changelog

All notable changes to the Gofer extension will be documented in this file.

## [3.2.2] - 2026-05-03

Refine the Rules and Memory panel, restore editable markdown flows, and tighten memory curation behavior

## [3.2.1] - 2026-05-03

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Shortened the extension README to the current manifest-backed command and
  settings surface.
- Removed stale VS Code documentation for unsupported command-palette actions
  and setup paths, including `Gofer: Configure WhatsApp Integration`,
  `Gofer: Test WhatsApp Connection`, `Gofer: View Pending Escalations`, and the
  older hidden context-window setting examples.
- Removed the unsupported autonomous notification-route settings
  `gofer.autonomous.notificationChannel`,
  `gofer.autonomous.whatsappPhoneNumber`, and
  `gofer.autonomous.emailAddress` from the public VS Code configuration
  surface and deleted outdated migration / WhatsApp guides.
- Removed the no-op public settings `gofer.claudeTerminalName`,
  `gofer.autoValidate`, and `gofer.showWelcome` from the manifest-backed VS Code
  settings surface after confirming they no longer had runtime consumers.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-30

Adds EnterpriseAI-first cross-CLI delivery for Gofer.

- Emits the full Gofer command set across Claude, Copilot, Codex, and Gemini.
- Makes EnterpriseAI the default workflow with explicit standard-profile opt-out.
- Adds app/non-app classification and a four-step AI-augmented process model for application delivery.
- Adds context bundle, contract pack, reuse scan, audit history, and red/green validation guardrails.
- Generates persona-specific Marp decks for enterprise decision makers.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-04-28

Fix Codex install repair and cross-CLI docs

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-25

Phase 1+2+3 source-of-truth generator + persona-pack visuals

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-25

Phase 1+2+3 source-of-truth generator

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-25

feat: source-of-truth generator + persona-pack visuals + /gofer:\* namespace

Phase 1: Single canonical .specify/commands/<stage>.md per stage emits to 8 CLI
surfaces. Byte-equivalence gate enforces no-regression. gofer codex doctor
read-only diagnostic. Per-CLI exclusion of 5 Claude-only stages.

Phase 1.7: 16 /gofer:\* additive aliases plus 3 control commands (/gofer:plan
plan-mode toggle, /gofer:side, /gofer:personality). ADR-003 namespace split.

Phase 2: 10 persona-pack visual templates. 7 visual-writer sub-agents. Two-pass
canvas. Mermaid tabular fallback.

Phase 3: Plugin manifests (.claude-plugin/plugin.json, .gemini/extension.json,
AGENTS.md, codex-config.toml). Stakeholder-pack assembler. mermaid-export.mjs.

186 tasks. 3296 tests passing. No-regression on existing /0-/10 commands, 37
sub-agents.

## [2.0.11] - 2026-04-21

security: fix 48 of 55 npm audit vulnerabilities — remove unused
wdio-vscode-service + @wdio/cli (23 CVEs in dev-only webdriverio v8 tree),
remove deprecated electron-rebuild duplicate, bump @electron/rebuild 3.7.2 →
4.0.3. Remaining 7 are mocha's transitive diff/serialize-javascript — no
upstream fix. Purely dev-only. All 2549 tests pass.

## [2.0.10] - 2026-04-20

infra(release): add scripts/sync-extension-resources.sh and wire into
release-auto.sh so every VSIX bundles current canonical content. Adds 10 missing
templates (stakeholder-comms, business-metrics, discovery, problem-brief,
assumptions, brownfield-analysis, spec-summary, session-handoff, journey/,
sequence-diagrams/) to extension/resources/templates/ so eai init delivers them.
Prevents the v2.0.5-v2.0.8 class of stale-bundle regressions.

## [2.0.9] - 2026-04-20

fix(vsix-bundle): sync extension/resources/ from canonical — ships Phase B
blast-radius + Cat 11 in /6, EnterpriseAI extensions in /0-/5+/7a, copilot) case
in install-optional-tools.sh. Previous v2.0.5-v2.0.8 VSIX bundles shipped
pre-blast-radius content because extension/resources was stale.

## [2.0.8] - 2026-04-20

feat(install): add copilot) case to optional-tools install scripts (bash +
powershell) — installs @github/copilot alongside existing claude,
@openai/codex-cli, and @google/gemini-cli. Reconciles drift with eai-cli bundled
copy.

## [2.0.7] - 2026-04-20

feat(commands): EnterpriseAI workflow profile extensions — adds required
sections to /0, /2, /3, /4, /5, /7a commands plus plan/tasks templates so
feature 029 integration tests pass. All 2549 tests now green.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-04-20

feat(commands): add EnterpriseAI workflow profile extensions to /0, /2, /3, /4,
/5, /7a plus plan/tasks templates — closes feature 029 content gap so all 2549
tests pass

## [2.0.5] - 2026-04-20

feat(validate): unify /6+/6a and add Phase B blast-radius analysis
(change-graph, interface-contract diff, observability, dependency/submodule
impact, rollback readiness) — rubric now 110 pts with new Category 11
