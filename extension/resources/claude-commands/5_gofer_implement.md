# Gofer Implement

You are executing the implementation plan by processing all tasks from tasks.md.
This is the **fifth stage** of the unified Gofer pipeline.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Prerequisites

This command expects in `.specify/specs/{feature}/`:

- `research.md` - Codebase analysis (from /1_gofer_research)
- `spec.md` - Feature specification (from /2_gofer_specify)
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan (from /3_gofer_plan)
- `tasks.md` - Task breakdown (from /4_gofer_tasks)

If missing, prompt user to run the prerequisite stage.

## Outline

1. Context health check
2. Load implementation context
3. Load scope boundaries
4. Check checklists status
5. Verify project setup
6. Execute tasks phase by phase (with feedback loops)
7. Track progress and handle errors
8. Output: Implemented feature code

---

## Step 1: Context Health Check

Before starting implementation, assess context window health:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/check-context-health.sh
```

**Evaluate thresholds (2025-2026 research-based)**:

| Status   | Token Usage | Action                                   |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Healthy  | < 50%       | Proceed normally                         |
| Warning  | 50-70%      | Use sub-agents, checkpoint every 5 tasks |
| Critical | > 70%       | Run `/7_gofer_save`, start new session   |

### Context Management Techniques

During implementation, use these techniques to preserve context quality:

1. **Sub-Agent Architecture** (Recommended)
   - Use Task tool with specialized agents for exploration
   - Each agent returns condensed results (1-2k tokens)
   - Keeps main context focused on implementation

2. **Observation Masking**
   - Old file reads become stale quickly
   - Re-read files only when actively editing
   - Avoid keeping full file contents in context

3. **Periodic Checkpoints**
   - Every 5 completed tasks, check context health
   - If Warning status: Run `/7_gofer_save`
   - This enables resumption with fresh context

**If compaction needed**:

```bash
/7_gofer_save  # Creates comprehensive checkpoint
# Start new Claude Code session
/8_gofer_resume  # Restores state with clean context
```

---

## Step 2: Load Context

1. **Run setup script**:

   ```bash
   .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks
   ```

   Parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and task list

2. **Load implementation documents**:
   - **Required**: tasks.md (task list and execution plan)
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, architecture, file structure)
   - **Required**: spec.md (scope boundaries and protected files)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities and relationships)
   - **Optional**: contracts/ (API specifications)
   - **Optional**: research.md (technical decisions)
   - **Optional**: quickstart.md (integration scenarios)

---

## Step 3: Load Scope Boundaries

Extract protected boundaries from spec.md and tasks.md:

1. **Read "Protected Boundaries" section from spec.md**
2. **Read "Protected Files" section from tasks.md**
3. **Build exclusion list**:

   ```
   PROTECTED_FILES:
   - path/to/file1.ts (reason: backward compatibility)
   - path/to/directory/ (reason: out of scope)
   ```

4. **Display to confirm**:

   ```
   ⚠️  SCOPE BOUNDARIES LOADED
   The following files/patterns are PROTECTED and must NOT be modified:
   - [list files]

   If you need to modify these, STOP and ask for approval.
   ```

---

## Step 4: Check Checklists Status

If `{FEATURE_DIR}/checklists/` exists:

1. **Scan all checklist files**
2. **Count completion status** for each:
   - Total items: `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
   - Completed: `- [X]` or `- [x]`
   - Incomplete: `- [ ]`

3. **Display status table**:

   ```
   | Checklist      | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
   |----------------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
   | requirements.md| 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
   | ux.md          | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
   ```

4. **If any incomplete**:
   - Display the table
   - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Proceed anyway?
     (yes/no)"
   - Wait for user response

5. **If all complete**: Proceed automatically

---

## Step 5: Project Setup Verification

Create/verify ignore files based on project setup:

### Detection Logic

- Git repo? → verify `.gitignore`
- Dockerfile exists? → verify `.dockerignore`
- ESLint config? → verify `.eslintignore`
- Prettier config? → verify `.prettierignore`

### Common Patterns by Tech Stack

Read tech stack from plan.md and ensure appropriate patterns:

- **Node.js**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
- **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `dist/`
- **TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `*.js.map`, `.tsbuildinfo`
- **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`

---

## Step 6: Parse Tasks Structure

Extract from tasks.md:

1. **Task phases**: Setup, Foundational, User Stories, Polish
2. **Dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution
3. **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, [P] markers
4. **Current progress**: Which tasks are already `[X]` completed
5. **Protected files**: List from "Protected Files" section

---

## Step 7: Execute Implementation

### Checkpoint Strategy

Create checkpoints (git commits) at strategic points:

| Checkpoint Point                 | Command                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Before starting each phase       | `git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: checkpoint before Phase N"`     |
| After completing each user story | `git add -A && git commit -m "feat: complete US1 - [description]"` |
| Before any risky operation       | `git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: checkpoint before [operation]"` |

**Risky operations requiring checkpoint**:

- Modifying database schemas or migrations
- Changing authentication/authorization logic
- Modifying core infrastructure or shared utilities
- Large refactoring (> 5 files)
- Deleting or renaming significant code

### Scope Enforcement

**Before EACH file modification**:

1. ✓ Check file path is in planned scope (listed in tasks.md)
2. ✓ Check file is NOT in Protected Files list (from Step 3)
3. If file is protected:

   ```
   ⚠️  SCOPE BOUNDARY VIOLATION
   File: [path/to/file]
   Reason: [from Protected Files list]

   This file is marked as protected and must NOT be modified.
   Options:
   1. Find alternative approach that doesn't touch this file
   2. STOP and ask user for explicit approval to cross boundary
   ```

### Execution Rules

1. **Phase-by-phase**: Complete each phase before next
2. **Respect dependencies**: Sequential tasks in order
3. **Parallel tasks**: [P] marked tasks can run together
4. **File coordination**: Same-file tasks run sequentially
5. **Scope check**: Verify every file against protected list

### Execution Order

1. **Setup first**: Project structure, dependencies, config
2. **Foundational next**: Shared components blocking user stories
3. **User stories**: In priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
4. **Polish last**: Documentation, optimization, final tests

### For Each Task

1. Read the task description and file path
2. **SCOPE CHECK**: Verify file is not protected
3. Load relevant context (data-model, contracts, research)
4. Implement according to plan.md architecture
5. Follow existing codebase patterns (from research.md)
6. **RUN FEEDBACK LOOP** (see below)
7. Mark task complete: Change `- [ ]` to `- [X]` in tasks.md
8. Report progress

### Feedback Loop (After EACH Task)

**Immediately after completing each task, run verification**:

```bash
# 1. Run relevant tests (if test file exists for this component)
npm test -- --grep "[component pattern]"  # or pytest -k "pattern"

# 2. Run linter on modified files
npm run lint -- [modified files]  # or ruff check [files]

# 3. Run type check (TypeScript projects)
npm run typecheck  # or tsc --noEmit
```

**Feedback Loop Rules**:

- If tests fail → **FIX BEFORE** proceeding to next task
- If lint errors → **FIX BEFORE** proceeding
- If type errors → **FIX BEFORE** proceeding
- **DO NOT** accumulate failures across tasks

### After Each Phase

Run full verification before proceeding:

```bash
# Full test suite
npm test

# Full build
npm run build

# Full lint
npm run lint
```

**Phase Gate**: Do NOT proceed to next phase if build is broken.

---

## Step 8: Progress Tracking

### After Each Task

```
✓ T001 Create directory structure - DONE
→ T002 [P] Set up configuration files - IN PROGRESS
```

### After Each Phase

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
  Phase 1: Setup - COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════
  Tasks completed: 4/4
  Files created:
    - src/index.ts
    - src/config.ts
    - package.json
    - tsconfig.json

  → Starting Phase 2: Foundational
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## Step 9: Error Handling

### If Task Fails

1. Report the error with context
2. **For sequential tasks**: Halt execution
3. **For parallel [P] tasks**: Continue others, report failed
4. Provide debugging suggestions
5. Ask user how to proceed:
   - Retry the task
   - Skip and continue
   - Stop implementation

### If Blocked

1. Identify the blocker
2. Check if it's a missing prerequisite
3. Suggest running earlier stage if needed
4. Document the issue in tasks.md

### If Something Goes Wrong (Rollback)

1. **STOP immediately** - don't make more changes
2. **Assess damage**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff
   ```
3. **Rollback options**:
   - Single file: `git checkout HEAD -- <file>`
   - All uncommitted: `git reset --hard HEAD`
   - To last checkpoint: `git reset --hard <checkpoint-commit>`
4. **Document** what went wrong in tasks.md
5. **Retry** with modified approach

---

## Step 10: Completion Validation

After all tasks complete:

1. **Verify all tasks marked [X]**
2. **Check implementation matches spec**
3. **Run automated tests** if they exist
4. **Validate against plan.md architecture**

---

## Step 11: Report and Continue

After implementation complete:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ✓ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: [Feature Name]
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Tasks: [N]/[N] completed

  Phases completed:
  - Phase 1: Setup ✓
  - Phase 2: Foundational ✓
  - Phase 3: US1 ✓
  - Phase 4: US2 ✓
  - Phase 5: Polish ✓

  Files created/modified:
  - src/models/user.ts (new)
  - src/services/userService.ts (new)
  - src/routes/users.ts (new)
  - src/index.ts (modified)

  Ready for next stage: /6_gofer_validate

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

If orchestrated by `/0_business_scenario`, the orchestrator will automatically
invoke `/6_gofer_validate` next.

---

## Resumption Support

If implementation was interrupted:

1. Parse tasks.md for `- [X]` completed tasks
2. Find first incomplete task `- [ ]`
3. Resume from that task
4. Report what was already done

**Note**: Implementation is stateful - it resumes from the last completed task.

---

## LLM Council Integration (Optional)

When council mode is enabled:

1. Complex implementation decisions go to all providers
2. Different approaches compared
3. Chairman synthesizes best solution
4. Usage logged to `.specify/logs/council-usage.jsonl`

---

## Observability Logging

At stage completion, log metrics:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/log-stage.sh 5_implement --complete --tokens [N] --compactions [N]
```

Update pipeline state to record stage completion:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/pipeline-state.sh update --stage 5_implement
```

Logs to: `.specify/logs/pipeline.jsonl`

---

## Required Output Schema

The implement stage produces source code files matching `plan.md` file
structure.

### Output Conventions

- Source files created/modified as specified in tasks.md
- Each completed task marked with `- [x]` in tasks.md
- No structured artifact schema — output is the implemented code itself

## Key Rules

- ALWAYS mark tasks complete in tasks.md as you finish them
- Use absolute paths for all file operations
- Follow existing codebase patterns from research.md
- Follow architecture from plan.md
- Report progress clearly after each task
- Stop on errors for sequential tasks
- Implementation must match specification
- Log stage completion for observability tracking
